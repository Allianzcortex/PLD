
Problem description:

```

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums, where nums[i] represents the score of the ith student. You are also given an integer k.

Pick the scores of any k students from the array so that the difference between the highest and the lowest of the k scores is minimized.

Return the minimum possible difference.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [90], k = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: There is one way to pick score(s) of one student:
- [90]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 90 - 90 = 0.
The minimum possible difference is 0.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [9,4,1,7], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are six ways to pick score(s) of two students:
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 4 = 5.
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 1 = 8.
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 7 = 2.
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 4 - 1 = 3.
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 7 - 4 = 3.
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 7 - 1 = 6.
The minimum possible difference is 2.

```

Basic idea:

Python 解法如下：

基本思路是先排序然后比较所有可能的 k 个选择的所有情况。这道题一开始看到有点慌，在想是不是要选择 2 个 pointer 之后
逐次比较接近，找到最小值。其实没这么复杂...

```Python

class Solution:
    def minimumDifference(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        nums.sort()

        res=float('inf')
        for i in range(len(nums)-k+1):
            res = min(res,nums[i+k-1]-nums[i])
        
        return res

```
