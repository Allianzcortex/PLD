```
Given a root of an N-ary tree, return a deep copy (clone) of the tree.

Each node in the n-ary tree contains a val (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its children.

class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> children;
}
Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples).

```

We have 2 solutions for it :

Solution 1 : Use DFS to copy the tree directly

```Java
